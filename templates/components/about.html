        <p class="text-lg">
            The Light of India restaurant is a classy and elegant Indian restaurant established in 1984. Our culinary
            philosophy is deceptively simple. We celebrate the very best of Indian food. Indian cuisine reflects a
            5,000-year history of various cultures interacting with the subcontinent, leading to its diversity of
            flavours and regional cuisines. The Northern Indian cuisine, which has been influenced by the Moguls,
            consists mainly of dishes & breads cooked in the clay oven “tandoor” accompanied by meats and vegetables
            slowly cooked in sauces, which are expertly seasoned according to the type of dish.
